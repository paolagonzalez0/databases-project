# databases-project

The purpose of this project was to learn and understand the process of loading data into a database using SQL. In this case, we loaded in monthly data for a simple hardware store. This included loading in new customers, orders, and order details for each month. This database allowed for addtional SQL query practice as well.

Some keywords I explored in this project include: relational database, entity relationship diagram (ERD), primary/foreign keys, JOINs (LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS/CARTESIAN), WHERE/HAVING/LIKE/LIMIT/MAX/MIN clauses, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CREATE/DROP table, CTEs, parametrized queries
